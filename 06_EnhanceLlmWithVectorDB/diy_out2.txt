I read the following book A book by the author edgar rice burroughs that is genre of science fiction and involves Tarzan the ape man and hated it, can you recommend something different. Maybe a love story? Here is a very good retelling of the actual fairy tale of Briar Rose by Jane Yolen. It is far more upbeat and different from your recent reading. Try reading this classic fantasy thankyou very much your website is very helpful
